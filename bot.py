"""
This module contains a Discord bot that responds to commands with various functions, such as:\n
            - returning a greeting.
            - a dog or cat fact.
            - weather information.
The bot is implemented using the Discord API,
and can be run on a Discord server by providing a valid token and the name of the target guild.

The module contains a Commands class with methods for accessing lists of different types of
commands, and several event handlers for responding to different events that can occur
within a Discord server, such as a user sending a message or the bot connecting to the server.
The module also utilizes the Logger, DogFact, CatFact, and helper modules for various functions.

Attributes:
---
    logger: An instance of the Logger class for logging system messages.
    dog_fact: An instance of the DogFact class for retrieving random dog facts from an online API.
    cat_fact: An instance of the CatFact class for retrieving random cat facts from an online API.
    TOKEN: A string containing the Discord API token for the bot.
    GUILD: A string containing the name of the target Discord guild for the bot.
    client: An instance of the discord.Client class for connecting to and
    interacting with a Discord server.

Methods:
---
    - on_connect(): A function that runs when the bot connects to the Discord server.
        Prints a message to the console indicating that the bot is connected.
    - on_ready(): A function that runs when the bot is ready to interact with the Discord server.
        Prints a message to the console indicating the bot's readiness and
        lists the members of the guild.
    - on_message(message): An event handler function that runs when a message is sent on the
        Discord server. Prints a message to the console and responds to the message with
        various functions depending on the content of the message.
